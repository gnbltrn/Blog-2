Summary of Chapter 6.  Install Git.

This chapter includes instructions on how to install Git Bash.  Given that I am new to github and git, I found it somewhat confusing at first.  I have been washing YouTube videos to familiarize myself with github and run into several videos about Git Bash, so after I completed the instruction and installed Git in my PC, I then realized they were the same.  
Summary
1.	Verify if you already have Git and consider updating if you have al older version.

git --version
## git version 2.39.1

2. Install Git for Windows
6.2 Windows
Option 1 (highly recommended) from this link:
https://gitforwindows.org/
Option 2 (recommended): Install Git for Windows via the Chocolatey package manager. I personally did not use this option.
choco install git.install

3.	Updating Git for Windows if you have an old version
git update-git-for-windows

The rest of the chapter if for Mac and Linux users, which I didnâ€™t use.

## Prompt:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Write a short (100-150 words) summary of the chapter you read in-depth.**
2. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
3. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.
